# pokeapi-automated-tests
Project created to practice testing automation using Cypress, under an existing project developed by Nicolas Roberto Chinaglia, Ricardo Almeida Alves and Silvio Eduardo Fratuchelli in collaboration with Matheus Sproesser

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v16.13.2` and `8.3.2` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

You can run the tests simulating a desktop or a mobile viewport

### Desktop

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode on a desktop viewport.
